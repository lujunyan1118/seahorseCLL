Version: 1.0.0
Author: Junyan Lu
Maintainer: Junyan Lu <junyan.lu@embl.de>
Description: This package contains the data of bioenergetic features of 152 CLL samples and 9 B cell samples, measured by Seahorse extracellular flux assay. This package also reproduces figures presented in the paper "Energy metabolism influences drug sensitivity and is co-determined by genetic variants in CLL" by Lu J, Böttcher M et al.
