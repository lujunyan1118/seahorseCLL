# Introduction

This package contains the data of bioenergetic features of 152 CLL samples and 9 B cell samples, measured by Seahorse extracellular flux assay. This package also reproduces figures presented in the paper "Energy metabolism influences drug sensitivity and is co-determined by genetic variants in CLL" by Lu J, BÃ¶ttcher M et al.

***

In this vignette we present the integrative analysis of CLL bioenergetic data set and the source code for the paper

This vignette is build from the sub-vignettes, which each can be build separatelly. The parts are separated by the horizontal lines. Each part finishes with removal of all the created objects.
